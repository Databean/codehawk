       If the function succeeds, the return value specifies whether the 
       key was pressed since the last call to GetAsyncKeyState, and whether 
       the key is currently up or down. If the most significant bit is set, 
       the key is down, and if the least significant bit is set, the key 
       was pressed after the previous call to GetAsyncKeyState. However, 
       you should not rely on this last behavior
       The return value is zero for the following cases:
       The current desktop is not the active desktop
       The foreground thread belongs to another process and the desktop does
       not allow the hook or the journal record.
