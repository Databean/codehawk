            desc="If this bit is set, the system's circular list of loaded locale identifiers is reordered by moving the locale identifier to the head of the list. If this bit is not set, the list is rotated without a change of order.
For example, if a user had an English locale identifier active, as well as having French, German, and Spanish locale identifiers loaded (in that order), then activating the German locale identifier with the KLF_REORDER bit set would produce the following order: German, English, French, Spanish. Activating the German locale identifier without the KLF_REORDER bit set would produce the following order: German, Spanish, English, French.
If less than three locale identifiers are loaded, the value of this flag is irrelevant." />

            These two methods are mutually exclusive, and the setting persists as part of the User's profile in the registry." />
