This level of impersonation can be used to access local resources such as files. When impersonating at this level, the impersonation token can only be passed across one machine boundary. The Schannel authentication service only supports this level of impersonation." />

The server process can also make outgoing calls to other servers while acting on behalf of the client, using cloaking. The server may use the client's security context on other machines to access local and remote resources as the client. When impersonating at this level, the impersonation token can be passed across any number of computer boundaries." />
