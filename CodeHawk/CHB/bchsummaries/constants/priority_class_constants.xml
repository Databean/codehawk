            desc="Process that performs time-critical tasks that must be executed immediately. The threads of the process preempt the threads of normal or idle priority class processes. An example is the Task List, which must respond quickly when called by the user, regardless of the load on the operating system. Use extreme care when using the high-priority class, because a high-priority class application can use nearly all available CPU time." />
      <symc name="IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS" value="0x00000040"
            desc="Process whose threads run only when the system is idle. The threads of the process are preempted by the threads of any process running in a higher priority class. An example is a screen saver. The idle-priority class is inherited by child processes." />
      <symc name="NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS" value="0x00000020"

This value can be specified only if hProcess is a handle to the current process. The function fails if the process is already in background processing mode.
Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:  This value is not supported." />

            desc="End background processing mode. The system restores the resource scheduling priorities of the process (and its threads) as they were before the process entered background processing mode.
This value can be specified only if hProcess is a handle to the current process. The function fails if the process is not in background processing mode.
Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:  This value is not supported." />
      <symc name="REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS" value="0x00000100"
            desc="Process that has the highest possible priority. The threads of the process preempt the threads of all other processes, including operating system processes performing important tasks. For example, a real-time process that executes for more than a very brief interval can cause disk caches not to flush or cause the mouse to be unresponsive." />
