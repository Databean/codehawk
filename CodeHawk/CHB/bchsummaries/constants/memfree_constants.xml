The function does not fail if you attempt to decommit an uncommitted page. This means that you can decommit a range of pages without first determining their current commitment state.

If you specify this value, dwSize must be 0 (zero), and lpAddress must point to the base address returned by the VirtualAllocEx function when the region is reserved. The function fails if either of these conditions is not met.
If any pages in the region are committed currently, the function first decommits, and then releases them.
The function does not fail if you attempt to release pages that are in different states, some reserved and some committed. This means that you can release a range of pages without first determining the current commitment state.
